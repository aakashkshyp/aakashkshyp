# Hello, I'm Aakash Kumar

I'm a dedicated **Data Analyst** with a keen interest in unraveling insights from complex datasets. Over the past couple of years, I've delved deep into the world of data analytics, harnessing various tools and technologies to extract meaningful information. My journey began at New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru, where I pursued a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, laying the foundation for my analytical prowess.

In my recent role at **Codify Software Services**, I had the privilege of collaborating with **Hexaware Technologies** as a Data Analyst for their internet banking system. My responsibilities encompassed everything from testing the system's functionalities to crafting visually compelling dashboards using **Power BI** and **Tableau**. I took pride in my ability to wrangle data using **SQL**, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for decision-making purposes.

Also worked with the **Atos Syntel**, I contributed significantly to the **Maxlife Insurance** project, where I played a key role in creating **SQL datasets** for **Tableau** recurring and **ad-hoc reports**. I crafted ad-hoc reports in Tableau Desktop, connecting various data sources and developing dashboards and reporting visualizations. My expertise in SQL allowed me to create complex queries involving multiple tables, as well as joins, sub-queries, and cumulative queries. I excelled in creating dashboards, scorecards, views, pivot tables, and charts for further data analysis. Furthermore, I demonstrated proficiency in connecting multiple data sources in Tableau to implement working reports.

Armed with a diverse skill set encompassing analytical tools, programming languages, and cloud platforms, I'm eager to continue my journey in data analytics. I'm driven by a passion for problem-solving and committed to leveraging my expertise to tackle real-world challenges and drive impactful insights.
