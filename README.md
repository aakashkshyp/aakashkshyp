I'm a dedicated **Data Analyst** with a keen interest in unraveling insights from complex datasets. Over the past couple of years, I've delved deep into the world of data analytics, harnessing various tools and technologies to extract meaningful information. My journey began at New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru, where I pursued a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, laying the foundation for my analytical prowess.

In my recent role at **Codify Software Services**, I had the privilege of collaborating with **Hexaware Technologies** as a Data Analyst for their internet banking system. My responsibilities encompassed everything from testing the system's functionalities to crafting visually compelling dashboards using **Power BI** and **Tableau**. I took pride in my ability to wrangle data using **SQL**, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for decision-making purposes.

Prior to this, at **Atos Syntel**, I contributed as an Associate Consultant, assisting **Maxlife Insurance** in harnessing the power of data through SQL datasets and Tableau reporting. It was here that I honed my skills in ad-hoc reporting, dashboard development, and SQL query optimization.

Before stepping into the professional realm, I embarked on an enriching internship journey at **APL Logistics**, where I got hands-on experience in analyzing inventory and warehouse data, optimizing stock levels, and enhancing operational efficiency.

Driven by a passion for problem-solving and armed with a diverse skill set encompassing analytical tools, programming languages, and cloud platforms, I'm eager to continue my journey in the realm of data analytics, leveraging my expertise to tackle real-world challenges and drive impactful insights.

Looking forward to connecting and exploring opportunities where I can contribute my skills and expertise to solve compelling data analytics problems.
